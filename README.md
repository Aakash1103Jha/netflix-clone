# Netflix Clone

The user interface of Netflix that we see might look simple and minimal but to get to that point requires a lot of well thought designing, processes, and implementations. This idea behind this project is to make a Netflix clone using React (TS), to get a better understanding of all those behind the scene optimizations and improve my overall hold on React.
